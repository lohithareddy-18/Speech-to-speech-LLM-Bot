# Speech-to-speech-LLM-Bot
# Speech-to-Speech Conversational LLM Bot  

An advanced conversational AI bot that leverages large language models (LLMs) for real-time speech-to-speech interaction. The bot processes user voice inputs, understands them through natural language processing (NLP), and responds with synthesized speech, providing an immersive and dynamic conversational experience.  

## Features  
- **Real-time Speech Recognition**: Converts user voice input into text using state-of-the-art speech recognition.  
- **Natural Language Understanding**: Processes and interprets user queries with an LLM for intelligent and context-aware responses.  
- **Speech Synthesis**: Responds with high-quality synthesized speech for seamless communication.  
- **Multilingual Support**: (Optional) Handles conversations in multiple languages.  

## Technology Stack  
- **Speech-to-Text**: [Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper), Google Speech API, or any preferred ASR engine.  
- **LLM**: OpenAI GPT, LLaMA, or any other fine-tuned large language model.  
- **Text-to-Speech**: [gTTS](https://pypi.org/project/gTTS/), Coqui TTS, or similar libraries.  
- **Frameworks**: Python, Flask/FastAPI for backend integration.  
- **Dependencies**: PyTorch, Transformers, SpeechRecognition, and more.  

## Installation  

1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/speech-to-speech-llm-bot.git
   cd speech-to-speech-llm-bot
2. Install dependencies:

'''bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Set up API keys (if using external services like OpenAI or Google):
Create a .env file and add your API keys:
makefile
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
4. Run the bot:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
Usage
Launch the application locally or deploy it on a server.
Speak into your device's microphone to interact with the bot.
The bot will respond with synthesized speech.
Roadmap
 Add support for more languages.
 Integrate emotion detection for empathetic responses.
 Enhance response latency for real-time interactions.
